# WebPaint

## This extension is no longer being worked on. I will not be cleaning up the code or adding more features. It was a great (and frustrating) development experience. While the extension is not particularly useful, the experience of pouring over complicated technical documentation will be useful experience for future development projects.

Firefox web extension that allows you to paint on the active web page. It works by placing a Canvas HTML element on the active page.

The code for this extension was improved and expanded on for my Web Development 1 final project. https://github.com/cdnexport/WEBD-1000-Final-Web-Project

Not compatible with Google Chrome.
